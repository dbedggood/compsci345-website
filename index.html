                    </p>
                    <p>Well-being refers to a notion of a healthy lifestyle in which all the dimensions of hauora are included.
                        An inter-relatedness of the dimensions is a part of evaluation and critical evaluation. It is suggested
                        that well-being be explored through the concept of hauora as described by the whare tapa whā model
                        (Durie, M. (1994): Whaiora - Maori Health Development. Auckland: Oxford University Press).</p>
                    <p>Lifelong well-being refers to life beyond school, future well-being needs, and the role and place of
                        physical activity within these.</p>
                    <p>Devise strategies involves considering what plans may need to be put into place to be proactive in ensuring
                        that physical activity continues to be a part of the life of the student. Strategies will be informed
                        by prior physical activity experiences and knowledge of anticipated future well-being needs.</p></div>

                                    <p>With respect to cricket, this initially began at age 4-5 with ‘backyard’ cricket with my dad, where
                                        I developed a sense of fun and enjoyment for and from 'the game'. This enjoyment lead to participation
                                        in junior club cricket programmes throughout primary school where I played in teams, predominantly
                                        made up of close school friends. This lead to even stronger friendships, which in turn, positively
                                        influenced my willingness to continue with cricket, even though the transition to 'hard ball'
                                        cricket (where a lot of kids stopped playing due to a lack of skill development and the fact
                                        that you could now get really hurt if struck with the ball).</p>
                                    <p>
                                        I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with my friends in an environment, other than school, whereby we were learning team values
                                        and "how to work together". Additionally, having good coaches at an early age allowed for the
                                        continued participation in cricket. These were because the coaches had been keen competitors,
                                        were passionate about the game, and had the appropriate skills and maturity to strike a balance
                                        between competing and participation. I was able to look up to and respect my coaches as a result.
                                        This then created a sense of idolism in me whereby I wanted to pursue cricket at an early age
                                        because 'Coach (name removed) thinks cricket is great'. These coaches also effectively created
                                        an enjoyable environment whereby a foundation was set for cricket to be fun as well as competitive.
                                        Because of this early exposure to a positive attitude, I was able to continue to build on this
                                        foundation after leaving the junior team, progressing through the years and increasing levels
                                        of ability. As a result of these factors, negative external influences where minimised, which
                                        again, resulted in my further participation in cricket, as I was not disheartened or "turned
                                        off' cricket at an early age. Consequently, through this exposure, I was able to development
                                        further skill leading to a natural talent for aggressive batting and athletic fielding being
                                        identified…
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Many social, cultural, and economic factors have influenced my participation in physical activity.
                                        Firstly my family, friends and the environment in which I live have played a positive role in
                                        my physical activity participation. I have been brought up in a family environment which promotes
                                        participation to physical activity, in any particular way, resulting in this attitude being nurtured
                                        in me from an early age. Both of my parents were once competitive body builders and remain physically
                                        active to this day. Bodybuilding is a sport that requires total commitment and determination
                                        in order to succeed. I have, therefore, adopted the same attitude towards physical activity,
                                        and consequently have had a degree of success, which has allowed me to consciously and somewhat
                                        'naturally' continue with physical activity. Additionally my parents have encouraged me to adhere
                                        to sporting activity as the strongly believe that sport teaches valuable life lessons, such as
                                        how to win and how to lose, that can be applied to life. 'State of Play' research states "Some
                                        parents view sport as a vehicle that improves life skills such as teamwork, communication, discipline
                                        and general social skills". This has been a predominant focal point in my upbringing, with my
                                        parents consistently emphasizing that valuable lessons learnt through sport, are easily translated
                                        and applied to life, in areas such as work and socializing. As a result of this I gained further
                                        mental and spiritual benefits. This is because the valuable lessons I was learning through sport,
                                        were essentially laying a dominant foundation for my overall values system which have been influential
                                        in developing my individuality…
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The community has provided a real sense of belonging in a sporting sense. Starting off playing junior
                                        cricket and football for the community clubs has progressed, through sport in the community,
                                        into my final year at College. ln an holistic sense, this sense of community has been engrained
                                        in me since I was 5 years old, and has, therefore, created a strong sense of pride and spiritual
                                        wellbeing in representing l my schools and a strong sense of community belonging.

                                    <p>ln the early years of my sporting life, activity and sports participation was gender-mixed. Girls
                                        and boys were given equal opportunity in a wide variety of activities in lower age level sports,
                                        girls often exceeding the physical prowess of the boys at that younger age. Throughout my life
                                        however, gender based pressures have never affected my choices or adherence to a type of physical
                                        activity,for example, playing rugby for feelings of masculinity or playing cricket because that
                                        is a middle class activity. I have simply pursued the activities that I have been most talented
                                        in, and therefore enjoyed the most. I continue to play these sports based on the positive experiences
                                        that I had when younger and not because of the stereotype surrounded by these sports. However,
                                        although I was not directly affected, I have been aware of naturally occurring factors related
                                        to gender in sport at a subconscious level. This included factors such as, as age increased,
                                        sport became influenced by common societal stereotypes, namely, what gender should play what
                                        sport. As a male, I have played sports that, sociologically, it was 'natural for me to play,
                                        resulting in positive well-being, irrespective of my gender. However, participation in sport
                                        could have negative outcomes where a participant did not fit or meet societal norms, for example,
                                        a male wanting to play netball, or, a young woman wanting to play football or rugby in a men's
                                        team. Sports participation and the positive spin-offs that come from physical activity would
                                        become secondary in the circumstances as outlined, the predominant drivers being, arguably, social
                                        identity, self-worth, and stereotypical prejudice.</p>
                                    <p>Media focus has had some influence on my physical activity and participation but has not directly
                                        influenced my choices of activity. However, through the emphasis of the benefits of being physically
                                        active through media, and increased societal awareness around the benefits of physical activity,
                                        I learned at an early age that being fit enabled me to enjoy the game more as well as provide
                                        a sense of greater well-being. Playing a highly physically demanding sport like basketball required
                                        me to attain and maintain a high fitness level. As a result of this I felt better in myself,
                                        and confident that I was partaking in a positive lifestyle choice. These attitudes then lead
                                        to the knowledge that a physically demanding sport required healthy eating habits and healthy
                                        life-style choices. For example, the need to play a full days' cricket would mean that I would
                                        not go out late and party the night before.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A very natural assumption exists that if a parent or parents of an individual is talented and experienced
                                        at a particular sport or activity, the individual will to be good at that sport/activity also.
                                        However, in challenging this assumption, this factor can actually be counter-productive; because
                                        of the likelihood that the individual will be brought up being constantly pressured to succeed
                                        and compete in the same field as their parents. For example, it has been assumed by people who
                                        know my family, that I would be a talented pipe band drummer. My dad was ranked fourth in the
                                        world for pipe band drumming, but this activity is one that does not interest me and I have not
                                        participated in this, therefore challenging this natural assumption. This can lead to a sense
                                        of disinterest and lack of personal identity in physical activity for the individual, as they
                                        may simply not like the activity, but are being pressured to participate so that their parents
                                        can 'relive' the experience. Also, the individual may strive for a sense of individuality, and
                                        for that reason, not want to follow in the parents footsteps. ln my case, having parents that
                                        do not participate in my chosen sports has been beneficial to my participation.</p>
                                    <p>Another assumption is that because of my height I would naturally pursue basketball as a chosen sport.
                                        This is a valid assumption in my case as I got introduced to basketball because I was always
                                        tall for my age, and have continued to play since then. However, basketball isn't necessarily
                                        a sport that requires you to be very tall (although it helps). Some of the most successful point
                                        guards in the NBA have been less than 6 feet tall, but logical assumptions would suggest otherwise,
                                        as the average height of an NBA point guard is 6 ft 3.</p>

                                    <p>Throughout my life physical activity has, and still does, play a big role. I have taken part in many
                                        different types of sports which include cricket, basketball, football, tennis, swimming and many
                                        other physical activities and games that I took part in through school. All of these different
                                        type of physical activity have played a big role throughout my life up to this time and will

                                        One of the major physical activities that I have participated in regularly throughout the majority of my life is cricket.
                                        I was first influenced to start playing cricket by my dad, who had played cricket when he was
                                        younger, and enjoys watching the sport. My mum also wanted me to be physically active and thought
                                        that it would be a good idea for me to start playing cricket, This is because by being physically
                                        active at a young age not only are you keeping fit and healthy, you are much more likely to "be
                                        academically motivated, alert, and successful". Another thing that influenced me to start
                                        playing cricket was that a lot of my friends were also playing cricket, which meant that I wanted
                                        to play with them. The influence from my parents and friends was the major reason that I started
                                        playing cricket. After I had played cricket for a while I grew to love the sport, which influenced
                                        me to keep on playing. I played cricket all the way through to year 12, influenced by my love
                                        of the sport, my parents who wanted me to keep playing, and the fact that a lot of my friends
                                        were in my cricket team. At the end of year 12 I decided to stop playing cricket. This decision
                                        was influenced by a few things. One of these things was that I no longer gained very much enjoyment
                                        from playing cricket anymore, and the love that I had had for the sport during my younger years
                                        was disappearing. Another influence was my coach, who I did not like very much as I felt that
                                        he did not manage the team very well. I also did not like that cricket was taking up so much
                                        of my time, what with two practises a week and a game that took all of Saturday. I felt that
                                        I could be spending this time much more productively. Because of these barriers I made the decision
                                        to stop playing cricket.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A major social influence that was one of the reasons that I started to play cricket was the fact
                                        that all of my friends were also starting to play cricket at the same time that I was. Because
                                        of this I wanted to play cricket as well, as hanging out with my friends was always a lot of
                                        fun. This was a major influence on me playing cricket throughout my life, as playing cricket
                                        was a great opportunity to talk to my friends and hang out, while also playing a sport that I
                                        enjoyed immensely. Through playing cricket I was also able to meet new people and make a lot
                                        of new friends, which also influenced me to keep on playing.

                                    <p>The "stay and play'' research done by SPARC into finding out why an increasing number of teenagers
                                        are dropping out of sport also supports why my friends influenced me to start and keep playing
                                        cricket. The research done by SPARC states that one of the main social reasons that teenagers
                                        stop playing sport is that it is considered "not cool" by their friends. Because a lot of my
                                        friends also played sport, sport was considered to be the "cool" thing to do, which meant that
                                        I really wanted to play cricket as a lot of my friends also played it and I was put in the same
                                        team as them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A big influence on my decision to play football at intermediate rather than get involved in other
                                        sports was that a lot of my friends were also playing football. As I enjoyed spending time with
                                        my friends I naturally wanted to play football as it meant that I would get to spend more time
                                        with my friends. However, it was also a social influence that was a big reason for me deciding
                                        to stop playing football and get involved in something else. When I reached intermediate a lot
                                        of my friends decided to go and play rugby, or were placed in a different football team to me.
                                        As the social aspect was the biggest reason that I was playing football I decided to stop as
                                        I was no longer in a team with any of my friends. This is why I did not continue with football
                                        later on in my life and why I now play rugby.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I valued cricket very highly throughout most of my life, which meant that I continued with this experience
                                        throughout most of my life. I valued cricket highly for many reasons. One of these was that it
                                        affected the physical aspect of my hauora positively, which meant that it helped me to keep fit
                                        and stay healthy. It was good for my aerobic fitness because we were training 3 times a week
                                        doing long runs and cardio work for one session. Because I was staying reasonably fit and healthy,
                                        the mental aspect of my hauora was also effected positively, as by staying reasonably fit and
                                        healthy I felt a lot better about myself mentally. Keeping fit and healthy means I had a body
                                        shape that I was comfortable with. Another reason that I valued cricket so highly was the social
                                        aspect. When comparing this to other sports like swimming and athletics which are sports that
                                        you do by yourself cricket was much more enjoyable. By playing cricket I was able to hang out
                                        with my mates and also make new friends. This affected the social aspect of my hauora positively,
                                        as I was spending quite a bit of time with my friends through playing cricket, and I was also
                                        making quite a few new friends because of cricket. Because I was staying fit and healthy, was
                                        feeling good about myself, and was making lots of new friend and spending a decent amount of
                                        time with the friends that I already had, the spiritual aspect of my hauora was also affected
                                        positively, as through all of these things I gained a lot of confidence in myself, and felt very
                                        positive about everything that was happening with my cricket. This also had positive aspects
                                        on other areas of my life such as my school work were because of the positive attitude bought
                                        on by playing cricket I had a real enthusiasm to get on with my school work. In a sense I had
                                        a balanced well-being which helped in other areas of my life. Overall, I valued cricket very
                                        highly, and it was an obvious choice for me to continue with the sport.

                                    <p>Throughout my football career I did not value football very highly. This was because I did not enjoy
                                        it as much as other sports that I played, and the only real reason that I continued on playing
                                        it was because my parents wanted me to. I did not enjoy playing football very much because my
                                        skill level was not as high as other people that I played against, and was seldom put in team
                                        with my friends</p>
